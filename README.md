# Week 16 Mon Lab #
### Overview  ###
In this lab, you will implement several core operations using the binary heap data structure. 

Binary tree space analysis
Complete binary trees
Min-heap / Max-heap insertion (sift-up and sift-down)
Removing nodes
Priority queue implementation using a heap
Heapsort
You will complete partially written C++ code (“pre-code”) that implements:
A vector-based binary heap
Insertion using sift-up
Removal of the root using sift-down
Removal of an arbitrary index (sift-up then sift-down)
